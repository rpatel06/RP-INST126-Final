# RP-INST126-Final

This is Riya's fruit themed Word Guessing Game! This is a simple game with: 
- One or more players
- The object of the game is to guess a secret fruit from a bank of words.
- Players can take turns and try to guess a letter that is possibly in the word.
- After guessing a letter, the game tells the player how many occurrences of that letter are in
the secret word.
- The game does NOT tell the player the position of letters in the word.

Additional features of my game are: 
- A fruit theme to the word guessing game.
- The game will tell the player how long the word is.
- The game will force the player to try to remember all the letters guessed so far, instead of displaying a list.

This game is created by Riya Patel for INST126. This game has contributions through our Code Review assignment since Medhnaa Saran reviewed mine, and Course Materials such as Zoom recordings and presentations were significantly helpful when creating this game.
